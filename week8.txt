Form Validation:

    Form validation is the process of checking if the data entered by a user is in the correct format. 
    The form will display error messages if any fields do not pass the validation tests.

    While it is important to validate any information on both the server-side and the client-side, 
    this lesson will cover some of the ways validation is handled on the client-side.
